                    Welcome to my website. This website was created to teach people about some popular programming languages that software engineers use. 
                These languages are used in companies ranging from small to large. These programming languages are high level programming languages meaning that 
                they are converted into instructions that the computer is then able to run and execute. Programming languages are essential to all software programs.
                They are used in all programs and contain the instructions for the computer to run.

            <h3>What is a programming langauge?</h3>
            
            <br>
            
            <p>
                A programming language is a special language programmers use to develop software programs,
                scripts, or other sets of instructions for computers to execute. The programming languages this website will cover are Python, Java, and C++.
